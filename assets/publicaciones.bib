The model includes dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar short-range interactions of tetrahedral symmetry that mimic hydrogen bonds, but it differs from the original Yukagua model in that dipolar and quadrupolar terms are not coupled. For this model we solve, using Baxter-Wertheim factorization technique, the Ornstein-Zernike relation for the molecular pair correlation functions closed by generalized mean spherical closures. From the molecular correlations we derive the atom-atom (oxygen-oxygen, oxygen-hydrogen, and hydrogen-hydrogen) pair correlations. We compare our results with those obtained from diffraction experiments and also from other theoretical treatments available in the recent literature including a modified version of the hypernetted chain integral equation for the SPC/E water model and also ab initio simulations of Car-Parrinello type.",

Chemical clusters are defined as sets of particles connected through particle-particle bonds that last for a given time $\tau$. Physical clusters are sets of particles that remain close together at every instant for a given period of time $\tau$. By using molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones system we obtain the percolation loci at different values of $\tau$ as the lines in the temperature-density plane at which the system presents a spanning cluster in 50\% of the configurations. We find that the percolation loci for chemical clusters shifts rapidly toward high densities as $\tau$ is increased. For moderate values of tau this line converges to the low-density branch of the liquid-solid coexistence curve. This implies that no stable chemical clusters can be found in the fluid phase. In contrast, the percolation loci for physical clusters tend to a limiting line, as $\tau$ tends to infinity, which is far from the liquid-solid transition line.",

This choice makes the deduction of equations more transparent. Equations for the pair distribution functions of one component systems as well as binary mixtures are obtained.

	abstract = {The steady state packing fraction of a tapped granular bed is studied for different grain
shapes via a discrete element method. Grains are monosized regular polygons, from
triangles to icosagons. Comparisons with disc packings show that the steady state packing
fraction as a function of the tapping intensity presents the same general trends in
polygon packings. However, better packing fractions are obtained, as expected, for
shapes that can tessellate the plane (triangles, squares and hexagons). In addition,
we find a sharp transition for packings of polygons with more than 13 vertices
signaled by a discontinuity in the packing fraction at a particular tapping intensity.
Density fluctuations for most shapes are consistent with recent experimental
findings in disc packing; however, a peculiar behavior is found for triangles and
squares.},

	abstract = "Assemblies of granular particles mechanically stable under their own weight contain arches. These are structural units identified as sets of mutually stable grains. It is generally assumed that these arches shield the weight above them and should bear most of the stress in the system. We test such hypothesis by studying the stress born by in-arch and out-of-arch grains. We show that, indeed, particles in arches withstand larger stresses. In particular, the isotropic stress tends to be larger for in-arch grains whereas the anisotropic component is marginally distinguishable between the two types of particles. The contact force distributions demonstrate that an exponential tail (compatible with the maximization of entropy under no extra constraints) is followed only by the out-of-arch contacts. In-arch contacts seem to be compatible with a Gaussian distribution consistent with a recently introduced approach that takes into account constraints imposed by the local force balance on grains.",

Among them, the MK-0617 ligand has proven to be a highly potent and orally active Î±4Î²1 antagonist. However, the binding mode of this ligand in the integrin binding site remains unknown. Herein we report a thermodynamic analysis of the interaction between MK-0617 (and one of its isomers) and the VLA-4 protein using molecular docking and the free energy perturbation calculations, based on a comparative model of the Î±4Î²1 receptor. Initial complex coordinates were taken from molecular docking assays and submitted to alchemical transformations. Free energy of binding ÎÎG values, derived from experimental IC50 values, were taken as a parameter for determining the most likely binding mode. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations of these ligands within the Î±4Î²1 binding site were carried out to elucidate the binding energy profile and identify the most significant residues. Our results indicate that MK-0617 fits within the binding site in a stretched conformation, pointing the carboxylate group towards the MIDAS ion. We observe that, despite the fact that the main contribution to the energetic binding process is due to the electrostatic ion contribution, the nonpolar contribution is not negligible.

It has been recently suggested that, under working conditions in which the damping is optimal, the PD has a universal response in the sense that the specific dissipative properties of the grains cease to be important for the design of the device. We present evidence from simulations of PDs containing grains of different sizes, shapes and restitution coefficients, that the universal response is also valid when fragmentation of the grains occurs (generally due to intensive operation of the PD). In contrast, the welding of grains (caused by operation under high temperatures) can take the PD out of the universal response and deteriorate the attenuation. Interestingly, we observed that even at working conditions off the optimal damping, the shape of the grains remains unimportant for the response of the PD.",

It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an atom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original ideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the chronological order of appearance of the amino acids along the evolution as inferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical speculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based mathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central object in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid an integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is preserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of amino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we propose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three dimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental one stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical representation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken into account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the genetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the close relationship between quaternions and rotations.",

  abstract = "The force network of a granular assembly, defined by the contact network and the corresponding contact forces, carries valuable information about the state of the packing. Simple analysis of these networks based on the distribution of force strengths is rather insensitive to the changes in preparation protocols or to the types of particles. In this and the companion paper [Kondic et al., Phys. Rev. E 93, 062903 (2016)], we consider two-dimensional simulations of tapped systems built from frictional disks and pentagons, and study the structure of the force networks of granular packings by considering network's topology as force thresholds are varied. We show that the number of clusters and loops observed in the force networks as a function of the force threshold are markedly different for disks and pentagons if the tangential contact forces are considered, whereas they are surprisingly similar for the network defined by the normal forces. In particular, the results indicate that, overall, the force network is more heterogeneous for disks than for pentagons. Such differences in network properties are expected to lead to different macroscale response of the considered systems, despite the fact that averaged measures (such as force probability density function) do not show any obvious differences. Additionally, we show that the states obtained by tapping with different intensities that display similar packing fraction are difficult to distinguish based on simple topological invariants.",

In the present work, we focus on the use of persistence analysis, which allows us to describe these networks in much more detail. This approach allows us not only to describe but also to quantify the differences between the force networks in different realizations of a system, in different parts of the considered domain, or in different systems. We show that persistence analysis clearly distinguishes the systems that are very difficult or impossible to differentiate using other means. One important finding is that the differences in force networks between disks and pentagons are most apparent when loops are considered: the quantities describing properties of the loops may differ significantly even if other measures (properties of components, Betti numbers, force PDFs, or the stress tensor) do not distinguish clearly or at all the investigated systems.",

title = "Chirality in a quaternionic representation of the genetic code",
abstract = "A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the authors (BioSystems 141 (10â19), 2016), is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and amino acids. The original representation associates with each nucleotide base a prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that assigns to each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer quaternion (amino acid type quaternion). The assignation is such that the essentials of the standard genetic code (particularly its degeneration) are preserved. To show the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the tertiary structure of the protein. The algorithm uses, besides of the type quaternions, a second kind of quaternions with real components that we additionally associate with the amino acids according to their order along the proteins (order quaternions). In this context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugate and by putting them into correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil, respectively. We then propose two diagrams in order to describe the hypothetical evolution of the genetic codes corresponding to both of the chiral systems of affinities: D-nucleotide bases/L-amino acids and L-nucleotide bases/D-amino acids at reading frames 5â² â 3â² and 3â² â 5â², respectively. Guided by these diagrams we define functions that in each case assign to the triplets of D- (L-) bases a L- (D-) amino acid type integer quaternion. Specifically, the integer quaternion associated with a given D-amino acid is the conjugate of that one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.",

The physical cluster definition establishes that a system particle belongs to the cluster if it is (nonspecifically) bonded to other particles of the cluster along a finite time period Ï (the residence time). Our theory has as main ingredients the Stillinger criterion of instantaneous connectivity, that involves a connectivity distance d, the generalized time-dependent pair distribution function of Oppenheim and Bloom that acts as a classical propagator and also the cluster pair correlation function for a weaker version of the physical clusters that requires connectivity just at the extremes of the time period no matter what happens in between. With these tools we express the time dependent pair connectedness function for the physical clusters in the strong sense as a path integral. The path integral is solved by means of a perturbation expansion where the nonperturbed connectedness function coincides with the generalized pair distribution function of Oppenheim and Bloom. We apply the theory to Lennard-Jones fluids at low densities and perform molecular dynamics simulations to check the goodness of diverse functions that appear in the theory.",

These simulations, with resolution at the particle level, allow for a clean measurement of the dune placement and proppant degree of mixing. The effect of the position of the injection points is considered by three different injection heights in the vertical cell. Different proppant injection strategies were also considered by using two different proppant types that can be injected in different orders or simultaneously as a mixture. We evaluate the position and shape of the settled dune. We measure the degree of mixing of the two proppant types by using the concept of mixing entropy. We have found that an injection point placed close to the bottom of the cell leads to a dune close to the injection points, and that an injection point at the middle or at the top of the cell leads to a rather flat dune. Injecting different proppant types in different orders yields distinctive proppant distributions. This helps in evaluating the benefits of positioning perforation clusters close to geological boundaries that favor fracture growth in the upward or downward direction as well as selecting the order of proppant mesh injection. All the simulations correspond to the early stage, before the âtraction carpetâ effect comes into play.",

title = "Effect of the trabecular bone microstructure on measuring its thermal conductivity: A computer modeling-based study",
abstract = "The objective of this work is to quantify the relation between the value of the effective thermal conductivity of trabecular bone and its microstructure and marrow content. The thermal conductivity of twenty bovine trabecular bone samples was measured prior to and after defatting at 37, 47, and 57â¯Â°C. Computer models were built including the microstructure geometry and the gap between the tissue and measurement probe. The thermal conductivity (k) measured was 0.39â¯Â±â¯0.06 W mâ1 Kâ1 at 37â¯Â°C, with a temperature dependence of +â¯0.2\%Â°Câ1. Replacing marrow by phosphate-buffered saline (defatting) increased both the computer simulations and measurement results by 0.04 W mâ1 Kâ1. The computer simulations showed that k increases by 0.02â0.04 W mâ1 Kâ1 when the model includes a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline between the tissue and measurement probe. In the presence of microstructure and fatty red marrow, k varies by Â±â¯0.01 W mâ1 Kâ1 compared with the case considering matrix only, which suggests that there are no significant differences between cortical and trabecular bone in terms of k. The computer results showed that the presence of a gap filled by phosphate-buffered saline around the energy applicator changes maximum temperature by <â¯0.7â¯Â°C, while including the bone microstructure involved a variation of <â¯0.2â¯mm in the isotherm location. Future experimental studies on measuring the value of k involving the insertion of a probe into the bone through a drill hole should consider the bias found in the simulations. Thermal models based on a homogeneous geometry (i.e. ignoring the microstructure) could provide sufficient accuracy.",

Local and global sensitivity analyses were implemented for identifying the parameters that most affect the detection. Magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficient of the antennas were evaluated separately. It was observed that the direct problem is highly sensitive to the dielectric properties of the tissues surrounding the calcaneus and to those of the calcaneus itself.

  abstract = "We report on a series of experiments in which a grain-sized intruder is pushed by a spring through a two-dimensional granular material composed of photoelastic disks in a Couette geometry. We study the intruder dynamics as a function of packing fraction for two types of supporting substrates: A frictional glass plate and a layer of water for which basal friction forces are negligible. We observe two dynamical regimes: Intermittent flow, in which the intruder moves freely most of the time but occasionally gets stuck, and stick-slip dynamics, in which the intruder advances via a sequence of distinct, rapid events. When basal friction is present, we observe a smooth crossover between the two regimes as a function of packing fraction, and we find that reducing the interparticle friction coefficient causes the stick-slip regime to shift to higher packing fractions. When basal friction is eliminated, we observe intermittent flow at all accessible packing fractions. For all cases, we present results for the statistics of stick events, the intruder velocity, and the force exerted on the intruder by the grains. Our results indicate the qualitative importance of basal friction at high packing fractions and suggest a possible connection between intruder dynamics in a static material and clogging dynamics in granular flows.",

We then use simulations to explore a broader range of parameter space, focusing on the friction between the particles and the base. We consider both static and dynamic basal friction coefficients, which are difficult to vary smoothly in experiments.

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) for phaseless imaging the human heel (modeled as a bilayer dielectric media: bone and surrounding tissue) and the calcaneus cross-section size and location using a two-dimensional (2D) microwave tomographic array. Computer simulations were performed over 2D dielectric maps inspired by computed tomography (CT) images of human heels for training and testing the MLP. A morphometric analysis was performed to account for the scatterer shape influence on the results. A robustness analysis was also conducted in order to study the MLP performance in noisy conditions. The standard deviations of the relative percentage errors on estimating the dielectric properties of the calcaneus bone were relatively high. Regarding the calcaneus surrounding tissue, the dielectric parameters estimations are better, with relative percentage error standard deviations up to ââ15\%. The location and size of the calcaneus are always properly estimated with absolute error standard deviations up to ââ3 mm.},

abstract = {Crystallographic data comes from a space-time average over all the unit cells within the crystal, so dynamic phenomena do not contribute significantly to the diffraction data. Many efforts have been made to reconstitute the movement of the macromolecules and explore the microstates that the confined proteins can adopt in the crystalline network. We explored different strategies to simulate a heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) crystal by means of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. We evaluate the effect of introducing restraints according to experimental isotropic B-factors and we analyzed the H-FABP motions in the crystal using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), isotropic and anisotropic B-factors. We compared the behavior of the protein simulated in the crystal confinement versus in solution, and we observed the effect of that confinement in the mobility of the protein residues. Restraining one-third of CÎ± atoms based on experimental B-factors produce lower B-factors than simulations without restraints, showing that the position restraint of the atoms with the lowest experimental B-factor is a good strategy to maintain the geometry of the crystal with an obvious decrease in the degrees of motion of the protein. PCA shows that, as position restraint reduces the conformational space explored by the system, the motion of the crystal is better recovered, for an essential subspace of the same size, in the simulations without restraints. Restraining only one CÎ± seems to be a good balance between giving flexibility to the system and preserving its structure. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.}

The process is akin to the flowback stage in the near wellbore zone of a hydraulic-stimulated well for hydrocarbon recovery. We consider different wall roughness and investigate its effect on particle production, final distance between walls, spatial particle distribution between the walls, and fluid production rate. We have found that the final distribution of particles changes significantly with small variations in the roughnesses of the walls. This in turn leads to production flow rates that may vary up to 50\%. Although the main driver of the production for unconventional wells is the propped fracture network, these results suggest that the roughness of the fracture walls seems to play an important role in the final conductivity and therefore in the ultimate recovery.}

abstract = { The interactions between particles in dense particulate systems are organized in force networks, mesoscale features that influence the macroscopic response to applied stresses. The detailed structure of these networks is, however, difficult to extract from experiments that cannot resolve individual contact forces. In this study, we showed that certain persistent homology (PH) measures extracted from data accessible to experiment are strongly correlated with the same features extracted from the full contact force network. We performed simulations known to accurately model experiments on an intruder being pushed through a two-dimensional (2D) granular layer and compared PH properties of full contact force networks and networks constructed using only the sum of the normal forces on each grain. We found that the main features were highly correlated, suggesting that data commonly available in experiments are sufficient for quantifying the structure of force networks in evolving granular systems. }

abstract={The flow of grains through narrow apertures possess an extraordinary challenge: clogging. Strategies to alleviate the effect of clogging, such as the use of external vibration or addition of smaller grains, are always part of the design of machinery for the handling of bulk materials. In this work, we study with numerical simulations the effect of adding self-repelling magnetic particles to a sample of grains. We consider a vibrated two-dimensional hopper with a small orifice through which disks flow and clog intermittently. We find that the magnetic repulsion has a second order effect in comparison with the effect of the size of the added grains. Small added grains ease the flow of the original species. However, when the magnetic repulsion is switched on for the added small grains their ``lubricating'' effect is usually lessened. Only for a narrow range of sizes of the added particles we observe a subtle improvement of flow rate of the original particles with magnetic repulsion.},

Such groups promote changes in both composition and complexity of the membrane significantly modifying its physicochemical properties. Human Langerhans islets amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is the main component of amyloid deposits found in the pancreas of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). hIAPP in the presence of membranes with oxidized lipid species accelerates the formation of amyloid fibrils or the formation of intermediate oligomeric structures. However, the molecular bases at the initial stage of the anchoring and stabilization of the hIAPP in a hydroperoxidized membrane are not yet well understood. To shed some light on this matter, in this contribution, three bilayer models were modeled: neutral (POPC), anionic (POPS), and oxidized (POPCOOH), and full atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Our results show that the POPCOOH bilayer increases the helicity in hIAPP when compared to POPC or POPS bilayer. The modification in the secondary structure covers the residues of the so-called amyloidogenic core of the hIAPP. Overall, the hydroperoxidation of the neutral lipids modifies both the anchoring and the stabilization of the peptide hIAPP by reducing the random conformations of the peptide and increasing of hydrogen bond population with the hydroperoxidized lipids.}

By tuning the system with the characteristics of the individual patients, our model reproduces a variety of spatial patterns of tissue regeneration and tumor growth, resembling those found in clinical imaging or biopsies. In order to calibrate and validate our model we study the process of liver regeneration after surgical hepatectomy in different degrees. In the clinical context, our model is able to predict the recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma after a 70\% partial hepatectomy. The outcomes of our simulations are in agreement with experimental and clinical observations. By fitting the model parameters to specific patient factors, it might well become a useful platform for hypotheses testing in treatments protocols.},

abstract = {Abstract Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are responsible for the long-chain fatty acids (FAs) transport inside the cell. However, despite the years, since their structure is known and the many studies published, there is no definitive answer about the stages of the lipid entry-exit mechanism. Their structure forms a Î²-barrel of 10 anti-parallel strands with a cap in a helix-turn-helix motif, and there is some consensus on the role of the so-called portal region, involving the second Î±-helix from the cap (Î±2), Î²CâÎ²D, and Î²EâÎ²F turns in FAs exchange. To test the idea of a lid that opens, we performed a soaking experiment on an h-FABP crystal in which the cap is part of the packing contacts, and its movement is strongly restricted. Even in these conditions, we observed the replacement of palmitic acid by 2-Bromohexadecanoic acid (Br-palmitic acid). Our MD simulations reveal a two-step lipid entry process: (i) The travel of the lipid head through the cavity in the order of tens of nanoseconds, and (ii) The accommodation of its hydrophobic tail in hundreds to thousands of nanoseconds. We observed this even in the cases in which the FAs enter the cavity by their tail. During this process, the FAs do not follow a single trajectory, but multiple ones through which they get into the protein cavity. Thanks to the complementary views between experiment and simulation, we can give an approach to a mechanistic view of the exchange process.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The electrical conductivity of trabecular bone at 100 kHz has recently been reported as a good predictor of bone volume fraction. However, quantifying its relationship with free water (or physiological solution) content and the conductivities of its constituents is still difficult. Methods: In this contribution, in silico models inspired by microCT images of trabecular bovine samples were used to build realistic geometries. The finite element method was applied to solve the electrical problem and to robustly fit the conductivity of the constituents to the literature data. The obtained effective electrical conductivity was compared with the Bruggeman three-medium mixture model using a physiological solution, bone marrow and a bone matrix. Results: The values for the physiological solution plus bone marrow (together as one material) and the bone matrix that best captured the bone volume fraction in the two-medium finite element model were &sigma;ps+bm = 298.4 mS/m and &sigma;b = 21.0 mS/m, respectively. Additionally, relatively good results were obtained with the three-medium Bruggeman mixture model, with &sigma;bm= 103 mS/m, &sigma;b= 21.0 mS/m and &sigma;ps= 1200 mS/m. Simple linear relationships between the proportions of constituents depending on bone volume fraction were tested. Degree of anisotropy and fractal dimension do not show detectable changes in effective conductivity. Conclusions: These results provided some useful findings for simulation purposes. First, a higher value for the electrical conductivity of bone marrow has to be used in order to obtain similar values to those of experimental published data. Second, anisotropy is not detectable with conductivity measurements for small trabecular samples (5 mm cube). Finally, the simulations presented here showed relatively good fitting of the Bruggeman mixture model, which would potentially account for the free water content and could rescale the model for whole-bone electrical simulations.},

  ABSTRACT={A long-standing debate regarding the dynamics of silo discharge revolves around the use of mono-dispersed circular or spherical grains in simplified two-dimensional models. It is well-known that granular systems composed of particles of the same size can generate crystal or quasi-crystal domains with specific structural and dynamic behaviors. Can this ordering affect the flow rate to an extent that monosized systems cannot be good models for realistic materials? In this work, we present simulations of the discharge of two-dimensional silos filled with binary mixtures of circular grains that conserve the same mean particle size. We address the question of how ordering affects the mass flow rate, in particular considering the limit of mono-sized systems. We find that the typical hexagonal order observed does not affect the flow rate significantly. However, the flow rate does exhibit a weak, nonmonotonic dependence on packing bidispersity that correlates with changes in the outpouring speed of grains in the vicinity of the orifice.}

abstract = { A conductivity test of proppant material consists in confining a sample of the granulate at high pressure and then set a flow through the pack. The proppant particle size is the main variable controlling conductivity, but also particle size dispersion is considered important. Even though several studies consider mixtures of proppants of different meshes, there are not clear evidences as to whether the changes in conductivity with respect to a monosized proppant are caused by the mix itself or by the overall change in mean particle size. Hence, we use numerical simulations to answer the question: Does particle size dispersion significantly affects the proppant conductivity if mean particle size is kept the same? We measure conductivity and permeability by simulating (via a coupled Computational Fluid DynamicsâDiscrete Element Method) the flow of water through binary granular packs. We find that size dispersion does not affect conductivity (in the dispersion range explored) if the mean particle size is conserved. However, we observe that in a binary mixture the large particles are subjected to larger stresses than in a monosized system, which makes them prone to crushing. }
